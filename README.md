Classes are at the core of object-oriented programming. They are used to represent an object with related attributes (variables) and methods (functions).
In python a class is created by the keyword class .
An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class.
They are defined as functions but with the keyword class followed by an indentation.
The definition of a class usually contains some methods:
The constructor method is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.
