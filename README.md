Classes and objects are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).
Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports the use of classes and objects.
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.It defines the properties and methods that objects of that class will have.
Classes are defined using the class keyword. The name of the class should be in PascalCase.
An object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained entity that has its own set of properties and methods.
Objects are created using the class() constructor. 
The constructor takes arguments that are used to initialize the properties of the object.
